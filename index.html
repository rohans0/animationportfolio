			Click and drag the red circles to mess with it. I used raylib to make this, it's essentially a cloth simulation, and I used verlet integration for better accuracy.

		<h3>animation system within game engine</h3>

		<a href="https://rynplynch.github.io/CSS452-Team5-FinalProject/">live web demo</a><br>
		<a href="https://github.com/rynplynch/CSS452-Team5-FinalProject">source code</a>
		<p>
			Group project and final project for game engine development class, an animation system added to a custom WebGL game engine (a majority of the class was understanding/coding parts within the engine rather than making it entirely).<br><br>

			It linearly interpolates between keyframes of object position, size, rotation, and	color, and was inspired by Godot's animation system which allows linear interpretation (along with other types like frame-by-frame) of most properties of objects by choosing key frames at times.
